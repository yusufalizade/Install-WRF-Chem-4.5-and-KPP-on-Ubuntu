# Install-WRF-Chem-4.5-and-KPP-on-Ubuntu

WRF-Chem is the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with Chemistry. The development of WRF-Chem is a collaborative effort among the community. NOAA/ESRL scientists are the leaders and caretakers of the code. The official WRF-Chem web page is located at the NOAA website. 

This shell script assists WRF-Chem users in installing the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) version 4.5 and Kinetic PreProcessor (KPP) on a 64-bit Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS system. Before installing WRF-Chem, the fundamental and required libraries such as Zlib, HDF5, NetCDF-C, NetCDF-Fortran, Jasper, Libpng, and MPICH must be installed. All required settings, libraries, WRF-Chem and WRF Pre-Processing System (WPS) will be installed automatically using this code.

Download this code to your computer and activate it with one of the following terminal commands:

chmod 777 Installation_of_WRF-Chem-4.5.sh

or 

chmod +x Installation_of_WRF-Chem-4.5.sh

Then, run the following command to install WRF-Chem version 4.5 on your system;

./Installation_of_WRF-Chem-4.5.sh

It is also possible to install WRF-Chem line-by-line. For this, you can open the code and copy each line in the terminal and press Enter.

At the end of the code, there are important links and references. You can use them to learn more about WRF-Chem.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions. I started the coding with my contact details.
